# HW3

I approached this assignment by following the directions step by step. Linking the Javascript files and CSS files to the HTML. Then programmed a button and HTML to accept user input. Making a function  to gather the variables and then programmed a multiplication table. I did have trouble with the errors and ran out of time before I have any working.
